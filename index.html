          <h3>Assessment &amp; Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in varied and fair assessment and evaluation. I ensure that students have detailed instructions, clear expectations, and many opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of a subject. I use open-ended evaluations, critical thinking exercises, and technological integration to challenge students while also providing support to ensure their success.

              <h4>Choice-based evaluation</h4>
              <p>
                I believe in students having the ability to choose how they demonstrate their learning to me. To this end, I provide a variety of assessments and evaluations during a course to give me a clear idea of a students' level of understanding. Also, I use open-ended evaluations and ones based on choice to give students more freedom to showcase their strengths. The evaluation shown here is a major evaluation in a grade 10 core French class, after finishing the short novella we read together in the class.

              <h4>Use of technology</h4>

              <p>
                I integrate technology into many areas of my teaching, and assessment and evaluation is one of them. Students today are very connected to technology and benefit in using it to demonstrate their understanding in new ways. The evaluation shown here is a project in a grade 10 core French class that required the use of video production technology. It is a great project for students at that level because they can record the presentation ahead of time and therefore practice, ask for teacher input, listen to playback, and re-record after self-correction.

              <h4>New place-mat evaluation format</h4>

              <p>
                This year I have been training on the new board-wide evaluation system. I am currently in the process of reevaluating my existing materials to suit the new method of evaluating student performance. I have been trying out the system with my input from this past term and I am finding it very easy to use. This image is a sample of the performance of one of my students in Career Studies according to the place-mat system, which I used to more accurately assess their overall success in the course along with my old method of calculating their final grade.

          <h3>Differentiated Instruction</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in a safe, supportive, and fair learning environment for all students. I have experience supporting a large variety of student needs and I use a variety of tools to support student success in my classroom. These include graphic organizers, review materials, exemplars, and a course website where students can find all the necessary materials and information at any time.
          </p>


          <div class="row-fluid">

              <h4>Graphic organizers</h4>

              <p>
                I have found graphic organizers to be an excellent learning tool in many courses. I use them to develop note-taking skills in academic classes, and I use them as cheat-sheets in applied classes. For large projects, I use them to help students organize their thoughts and plans ahead of time. This graphic organizer is from a grade 9 French Immersion class. Rather than copying a lot of notes, students would fill in just the blanks when learning a new concept, and then we would focus on using it in context.

              <h4>Review materials</h4>

              <p>
                I support my students' ability to prepare for major evaluations by providing extensive review materials that narrow down what is important and help them develop organization and study skills. Depending on the class and the level, I use different strategies for review. In French Immersion classes, I often do student-directed review, with each student being responsible for a small part of the overall review. In many other classes, however, like as in the example here from a Civics class, I provide questions and students fill in the information during class time so they can work individually or collaboratively. Then, before the evaluation takes place, the class goes over all the answers together so they are all on equal footing going into the evaluation.

              <h4>Supporting student success</h4>

              <p>
                What sort of support I provide when students are doing a task depends heavily on the class and the level, but at a minimum I provide clear verbal and written instructions, a rubric that shows clearly how students will be evaluated, and class time with teacher support. Depending on the assignment, I also provide exemplars and/or do evaluation in stages, giving opportunities for feedback throughout the process to create an environment where they can demonstrate their learning most clearly. The sample document here is an overview of a task done in an applied-level core French class that was done in stages, with exemplars, class time, and frequent teacher feedback. A scanned final product from one group is also included as an example of what the students produced at the end.

          <h3>Innovation</h3>
          <p>
            I have found as I have gained experience as a teacher that innovation is my greatest strength as an educator. I produce new and engaging class activities for every class I teach and constantly try new things and update old ones. I enjoy trying new things, using new techniques, and sharing resources with colleagues to give students the best learning experience that I possibly can.

              <h4>Role-playing games</h4>

              <p>
                One of my favourite ways to immerse students in a subject is to use role-playing games. In this particular one, created for grade 10 Canadian History, each student was a representative for a country at an international conference in early 1914. They each met with every other country and had to meet certain goals for their country. At the end, the results of their discussions with other students resulted in alliances, betrayals, and declarations of war that mirrored closely those of the beginning of the First World War. It was a great learning tool to understand the motivations of the countries involved and to see how alliances could turn a small conflict into a world war.

              <h4>Real-life connections</h4>
              <p>
                Another highly successful role-playing activity I use often is the first activity I do when I teach the Careers course. In this activity, each student gets a career, a salary, and a life (a family, student debt, job requirements, and so on) and has to make a monthly budget. However, the budget is not the real focus of the activity – throughout the time while they are working on their numbers, I make changes to the world they live in (such as higher gas prices, pay cuts, and tax breaks). This effectively introduces many concepts for the course, but, more importantly, helps students experience the realities of adult life and generates excellent discussion from the students afterwards.

              <h4>Different perspectives</h4>

              <p>
                When I teach a course, I try to find different ways to approach a subject to make it accessible to more students. I use this particularly in French classes, where I use games, student-directed contextual activities, and media to develop their communication skills. Here I provide one activity I use in French Immersion to help students with a variety of skills, such as pronunciation, grammar, and transferable language skills.

          <h3>Student engagement</h3>
          <p>
            I have a lot of success engaging students in my classes. I have found that a variety of strategies achieve these best, the first of which is my own enthusiasm and passion for the subject. The more I demonstrate sincere interest in what I am teaching, the more the students make an effort to be interested as well. My innovative lessons and activities help get their attention, but they cannot do one of those every day. However, some things I do every day keep that engagement going throughout the semester.

              <h4>Technology</h4>
              <p>
                I use technology extensively in the classroom. Students today are generally tech-savvy and I use a variety of online resources and media to engage them in their learning. One particularly interesting technological integration I used in a Canadian History class is outlined here.
              </p>

              <p>
                This past semester, I used a texting-based activity in a grade 10 Canadian History class. When we were about to discuss the stock market crash of 1929, I first explained simply how a stock market works and then we played a game where students could text a number to place buy or sell orders and a live website would match them and adjust the stock price accordingly. At first, the game went well and the price was steady, but then I manipulated the market to raise prices for a while. When I stopped, the market started to fall, then students panicked and the market crashed. Students loved getting to legitimately use their cell phones for learning purposes and it meant they understood well how it was possible for the people in 1929 to panic the way they did. Trying to find ways to use the fact that most students have cell phones as a way to promote learning rather than as a distraction is an ongoing challenge I have given myself for the future.

              <p>
                Keeping the curriculum relevant to real life is very important in engaging students in their learning. I integrate current events not only into the Civics course but also into Canadian History, Canadian Geography, and French classes, in which I often use news broadcasts as practice listening exercises and as opportunities to initiate spontaneous discussion. This example is a task for an applied French class where they had to find an article and explain it to the class in a few sentences (with previous teacher support and feedback ahead of time).

                Students in my classes benefit from skill development that will benefit them in many different courses and in many different applications. In all my classes, we spend time on study and test-taking skills, critical thinking, and literacy. Here is a task that integrates many diverse skills – communication, responsibility, and organization – all in a context that is useful for the real world as well as other courses.

                I use discussions and debate frequently in my courses. They are excellent formative assessments for critical thinking and communication skills and in French classes they encourage spontaneous production. Even in core French classes, I use highly structured debates to get students comfortable speaking semi-spontaneously – they have rebuttals prepared ahead and then they just need to find the best one in the debate itself. This is an organizer I give students in grade 10 core French to prepare ahead of when we do a debate in class.

              <p>
                I believe that cultural education and acceptance of diversity are key components of any school community. This is an essential part of my critical thinking integration in the classroom – giving students opportunities to see things from another person's perspective and appreciate their needs and interests that may be different from the student's. Along with integration of diversity issues in class discussions and subject material in courses, I create evaluations that expose students to different ideas, beliefs, and human qualities to develop in them a sense of respect for the diversity around them. This is a major project my French Immersion Canadian Geography class did where each student had to help a different immigrant choose where to settle in Canada based on their needs and interests.

                I integrate critical thinking into the vast majority of my evaluations. This includes everything from test questions that require explaining an opinion to assignments that ask for critical analysis of media. One particularly successful critical thinking assignment I created is one where students in the Civics course create their own political party after having learned about the political spectrum, available here. This open-ended assignment gives students a lot of freedom to be creative and yet evaluates their ability to really consider what a party being "left-wing" or "right-wing" really means.
